    <bool name="audioUseDynamicRouting">false</bool>
    <!-- Audio routing policy for all H/W variants. Each item represents policy for one variant.

         Each item is defined in this format:
         physicalStreamNumber:(streamType,)*StreamType#physicalStreamNumber:...

           Stream type is logical stream type to route to the physical stream. Currently defined
           types are: call, media, nav_guidance, voice_command, alarm, notification, system, safety,
             and unknown
               unknown is for stream not tagged with specific contents.
           physicalStreamNumber should be [0, maxNumberOfPhysicalStream - 1].
         There is no "radio" as radio routing is outside android (for external module) or same as
         music (for android internal module)

         OEM can put multiple policies as item and VEHICLE_PROPERTY_AUDIO_HW_VARIANT in vehicle HAL
         can decide which policy to use for the given H/W. This allows OEMs to support multiple
         audio policy from single android S/W by detecting system's audio capability in
         vehicle HAL.-->
